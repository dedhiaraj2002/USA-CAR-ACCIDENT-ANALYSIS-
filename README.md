# USA-CAR-ACCIDENT-ANALYSIS-

## Overview

Welcome to the US Car Accident Analysis project! In this project, we leverage the power of R programming to conduct an in-depth exploration of car accident data in the United States. Our analysis covers three key aspects: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing, and Linear Regression with Forward-Backward Testing.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive deep into the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to car accidents in the US.

- **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulate and test hypotheses to validate or challenge assumptions about factors contributing to car accidents.

- **Linear Regression with Forward-Backward Testing:** Utilize linear regression models to explore the relationships between variables and predict outcomes. The forward-backward testing approach ensures robust model selection.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the analysis:

1. Execute the EDA section to explore the dataset visually.
2. Review the Hypothesis Testing section to validate assumptions.
3. Dive into Linear Regression with Forward-Backward Testing for predictive modeling.

Feel free to customize and adapt the code to suit your specific needs.
